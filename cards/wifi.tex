You have developed an open source public WiFi management system. Another municipality have replicated it. You use it to plan where to put hubs and do maintenance. It has been in use for a couple of months. The main end users of the system are **civil servants** but **citizens** also use one aspect of it to connect to the WiFi (add both actor cards). Public organization 1 is Commissioning, 2 is Replicating.
